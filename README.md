(Pick an Origin (e.g. Walnut Creek) and a Destination (e.g. San Francisco).  Write a Python program to find the travel time(based on CURRENT traffic) of the origin and destination. Record the travel time every 5 minutes for 1 hour. Store the time of recordings and the travel time with traffic(in seconds) in a pandas DataFrame.
